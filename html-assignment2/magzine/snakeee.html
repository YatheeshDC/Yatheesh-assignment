            Most snakes live on land, but there are about 70 species of snakes that live in the Indian and Pacific 
            oceans. Sea snakes and their cousins, kraits, are some of the most venomous snakes that exist, but they 
            pose little threat to humans because they’re shy, gentle, and their fangs are too short to do much 
            damage.

      <article><p>There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they’re found everywhere except in Antarctica, Iceland, 
        Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. About 600 species are venomous, and only about 200—seven percent—are able to kill or 
        significantly wound a human.</p>

        <p>Nonvenomous snakes, which range from harmless garter snakes to the not-so-harmless python, dispatch their victims by swallowing 
        them alive or constricting them to death. Whether they kill by striking with venom or squeezing, nearly all snakes eat their food 
        whole, in sometimes astoundingly large portions.</p>
